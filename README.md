**(1) Data Description**
Provide a full descriptive summary of the dataset, including information such as the number of observations, summary statistics, number of variables, name and type of variables, what the variables mean, any issues you see in the data, any other potential issues related to things you cannot directly see, how the data were collected, etc. Make sure to use bullet point lists or tables to summarize the variables in an easy-to-understand format.

(2) Questions

I have chosen to address question 2: "We would like to know which "kinds" of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data so that we can target those players in our recruiting efforts".

My specific question pertains to hours played based on experience and age, and it is as follows:

Are experience and age reliable predictors of hours of minecraft played?

Since we are predicting a numerical value and not a category, we will use linear regression to provide the researchers with a graph of age versus hours played. The linear regression is appropriate for making large conclusions as opposed to predicting a single new data point. As for our third variable, experience, we will colour the points on the graph to disinguish this variable. We will not be using a plane of best fit because these 3D models can be inaccessible and hard to read.
